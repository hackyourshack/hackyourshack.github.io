## Content Management

### General

All content will be stored as markdown files.

All content will be stored in repositories apart from the platformÂ´s implementation.

The different sections (storage, magazine, handbook, events) can have different templates, front-matter and stylesheets.

> **YFM (YAML FrontMatter):** The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:
>
> ```
> ---
> layout: post
> title: Blogging Like a Hacker
> ---
> ```
