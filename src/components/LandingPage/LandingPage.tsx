          Make meaningful things and improve your home. If you can makedo, you
          won't need neither many resources nor special tools. You might well
          find all you need on the street, because some one-eyed people consider
          it useless.

          Hack Your Shack is the platform for low-tech solutions. Here you can
          learn how to build a solar oven, a grey water tower, a plastic bottle
          cutter or even a whole shack and share your own creative solutions
          with other people around the world. What makes Hack Your Shack so
          special is that the provided hacks do not require any prior knowledge,
          extensive tools or expensive building materials, so you can get
          started right away. Have fun!

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Around one billion people worldwide live in slums, and the trend is
          rising. So far, however, no platform addresses the challenges of
          people who live in an environment with little infrastructure and few
          resources (money, building materials, tools). Hack Your Shack wants to
          change this and make existing knowledge accessible and expand it as
          empowerment for all. Hack Your Shack consists of an enthusiastic and
          dedicated team and is a non-profit organization in formation. Do you
          want to support our mission? We are looking for sponsors, content
          partners and multipliers.
