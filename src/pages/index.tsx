            Make meaningful things and improve your home. If you can makedo, you
            won't need neither many resources nor special tools. You might well
            find all you need on the street, because some one-eyed people
            consider it useless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hack Your Shack is the platform for low-tech solutions. Here you can
            learn how to build a solar oven, a grey water tower, a plastic
            bottle cutter or even a whole shack and share your own creative
            solutions with other people around the world. What makes Hack Your
            Shack so special is that the provided hacks do not require any prior
            knowledge, extensive tools or expensive building materials, so you
            can get started right away. Have fun!

          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            Around one billion people worldwide live in slums, and the trend is
            rising. So far, however, no platform addresses the challenges of
            people who live in an environment with little infrastructure and few
            resources (money, building materials, tools). Hack Your Shack wants
            to change this and make existing knowledge accessible and expand it
            as empowerment for all. Hack Your Shack consists of an enthusiastic
            and dedicated team and is a non-profit organization in formation. Do
            you want to support our mission? We are looking for sponsors,
            content partners and multipliers.
